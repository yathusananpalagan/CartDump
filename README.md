# CartDump

**CartDump** is a work-in-progress mod for **R.E.P.O** that makes the in-game **Cart equippable** by the player, with rules to prevent misuse.

⚠️ **This mod is still in active development. Expect bugs and incomplete features.**

## 📦 What CartDump Does

- Makes the **R.E.P.O Cart equippable**
- Allows the cart to be placed into the player’s inventory
- Prevents permanent cart carrying by automatically removing it after a delay
- Ensures the cart can **only be equipped inside the extraction zone**

---

## ⏱ Current Behavior

- The cart can be equipped **only inside the extraction zone**
- **After 5 seconds**, the cart is automatically **unequipped** from the player
- This behavior is temporary and used for testing and balancing

---

## 🛠 Planned Features

- Automatic unequip if the player leaves the extraction zone
- Configurable timers and conditions
- Improved feedback (UI / sound / logs)
- Multiplayer behavior testing

## 🎭 Just for Fun Changes

In addition to the main functionality, this mod includes some **non-serious changes** made purely for fun:

- Some **enemy names have been changed**
- These are mostly **inside jokes** and nicknames used by me and my friends
- They do **not** affect gameplay, stats, or behavior
- These changes may change, expand, or be removed at any time

This section exists purely for amusement and personal flair 😄

## 🚧 Development Status

- Early development
- Core mechanics still changing
- Not feature-complete
- Not fully balanced

Do **not** expect final behavior yet.
